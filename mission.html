                    <h2>Mission: Why Come to Dartmouth?</h2>
                    <p>Dartmouth is a school that is undeniably isolated. If you are a potential competitor, or coach, you may have concerns,
                        such as transportation logistics. It&apos;s true that Hanover is surrounded not by city blocks but by the woods and 
                        the mountains of the Upper Valley. It&apos;s fitting, then, that Dartmouth&apos;s motto is “Vox Clamantis in Deserto,” 
                        meaning “The voice crying out in the wilderness.” 
                        Because our goal at Dartmouth is to be those voices, the trailblazers seeking out the path to new knowledge.
                        It&apos;s a model for our educational philosophy, which align with the mission of Science Olympiad, 
                        always reaching for innovation in STEM. 
                        Dartmouth Undergraduate Science Olympiad&apos;s mission is to encourage STEM literacy, critical thinking, 
                        and creation of knowledge through annual invitationals. We aim to make scientific pursuits fun and fulfilling, 
                        and foster high school students&apos; learning hearts and scholarly passions.
                        So, yes, it&apos;s true, it can be a journey to get to Dartmouth. 
                        But as us students know, the experience you will have here is worth it.
                        </p>
                    <h2>History: Learn from the Past, Look to the Future</h2>
                    <p>Before the current iteration of Science Olympiad at Dartmouth, a tournament was held during the 2017-18 season. 
                        Unfortunately, there would then be a hiatus of several years of no competitions at Dartmouth. :&lpar;<br> 
                        <br>
                        However, Dartmouth&apos;s status as the only Ivy League school without an annual invitational tournament is now being rectified. 
                        In early 2024, a group of Dartmouth undergraduates came together to form the Dartmouth Undergraduate Science Olympiad organization.
                        In 2025, Science Olympiad will return to Dartmouth, hosting the Dartmouth College Invitational Tournament for Division C (high school). 
                        We are now committed to making Science Olympiad at Dartmouth a yearly event. This time, we are here to stay.<br>
                        <br>
                        In the 2025 Tournament, we are committed to running all 23 Division C events in accordance with the 
                        national Science Olympiad, Inc. rules. Dartmouth students who have had previous experience as 
                        competitors in high school will be in charge of all events, and additionally writing original tests. 
                        We aim to deliver a fun and enriching experience for all.
